# predicting-the-present-2020-group-1

We replicated some of the results from paper [Predicting the Present with Google Trends.](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2011/ptp.pdf). We focused on 3.1 Motor vehicles and parts and were able to replicate everything in that session using original data. We also explored some extensions of the session, such as replicate the results with data from different time period, evaluate different model. We found a model that that can forecast sales for a whole year by using only previous years data. We tested the model and the $R^2$ ranged from 0.88 to 0.97 for years 2014-2019. We made our predictions for the year of 2020. A [flexdashboard](https://xiaonazhou.shinyapps.io/visualizing_diff_models/)  that helped us evaluate and visualize different models was developed.
